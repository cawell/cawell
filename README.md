# **Hello, I'm Wellington! 👋**

### **Also known as Well or Cawell**

I'm a lover of coffee ☕, music 🎵, and, of course, technology. My journey in the programming world is fueled by curiosity and the fascination of always creating something new that will help in some situation.

## **🌟 A Little About Me**

I'm forging my path in software engineering, a field that fascinates me with its ability to turn ideas into reality. Every line of code is one more step in this adventure.

### **🎓 Education**

- **Software Engineering Student**: Here, I'm not only learning theories and practices but also exploring how technology can shape our future.

### **💡 Skills and Interests**

- **Ruby and Ruby on Rails**: I've dived headfirst into Ruby, an elegant and powerful language, and Rails, its amazing framework for web development.
- **JavaScript and Its Flavors**: JavaScript is my window to the web. I'm exploring its various forms, including React for dynamic interfaces and Node.js for server-side.
- **React Native**: The magic of creating mobile applications with the same knowledge base I use for the web is fascinating.
- **Architecture and Agile Methodologies**: I'm always looking for ways to better structure projects and adopt agile practices that make sense in the real world.

## **🌱 Constantly Evolving**

I believe learning never ends. I'm always experimenting, failing, learning, and growing. This is how I see technology: a space to explore, innovate, and continuously improve.
